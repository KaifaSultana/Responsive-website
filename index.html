            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag">Education Types</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">The education system too has undergone a change during this time. The traditional chalk boards are now almost replaced by white boards and smart boards. Nowadays, the number of schools have almost increased exponentially in the last century. The content of books have also changed. Nowadays, students are not only taught about science and mathematics, but they are also given classes on subjects like history of the world, moral values, geography, etc in schools as well.

                But it is disheartening to see that even though the books we use in the education have changed, but there has been almost no change in the methodology of education. The teachers, even today, teach the students the art of “parrot learning” rather than helping them develop the concepts about the topics they are taught about. The exams too are based on testing how well a student is able to memorize what he was taught in class, rather than testing how well they have understood a topic and testing their knowledge and concepts. Students study in this manner thinking that they ought to memorize things and not try to understand the concepts behind them. The parents also pressurize and expect their children to follow the same.</p>
